# Tamagotchi-1
My very first project build with HTML, CSS, JS 
with the ability to name your pet, feed, get older and turn off the lights. Also, you can upgraded your pet when you press some buttons. 


How to play :
When you open the link you will see an "alert" to NAME your pet.

Accept the next "alert" to take care of your pet and start the game.

Press every button to either feed, sleep, age etc ... 

Make sure to play with pet, also to make it older by pressing the button so you can upgrade the MONSTER. 

The last thing don't let you pet over sleep or he will go to HAVEN. 

I hope you enjoy my small frist project. :)
